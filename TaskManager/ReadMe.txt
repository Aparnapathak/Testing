About the Task Manager CRUD React App

1.This is a basic CRUD app made with react and bootstrap
2.As per the code functionality, the application fulfils the purpose for managing the tasks 
3.You can create,read,update and delete tasks using this task manager
4.You can type the task and click on add todo for creating a task
5.Once a task is completed, click on it to mark it crossed/competed
6.You can use the two icons for updating and deleting the added tasks

Apart from the functionality, there is some code that is currently non-functional and needs improvement -

1.The edit button shows the manipulation which is currently not functional
2.The edit button is currently just for visual purpose that can be further improved\
3.The search button and the search icon is not functional
4.The completed section below shows how the completed tasks will look together
5.A few icons and buttons can be further added to enhance the visual aesthetics
